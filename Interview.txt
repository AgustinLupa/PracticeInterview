1) 
I have just graduated as a System Analist. I know my way around a team and  
had multiple opportunities to put my knowledge into practice as a programmer, system developer
and data analyst. I am passionate, hard-working, and extremely responsible.  
I am also looking forward to put into practice all the things I have learned during my time at 
university.

2) I left my job because I wanted to start my career and the timings were not compatible.

3) I have a good impression of your company because your proyects and contributions are well-known 
in the industry.

4) Because I admire the company’s passion for creating super intuitive and attractive software, and 
I would appreciate the opportunity to be a part of your team.

5) recently, I have been working on the development of an ERP System, and I learned new technologies  
related to accounting and software delepment planning.

6) Last year, I was requested the development of a custom system from scratch that would let
clients make orders from the web, and send notifications to the owner to approve the order.
I efficently analysed the processes and requirements, and was able to deliver a 
quality product while accomplishing all deadlines.

7) I had a coworker in my last job that didn't seem to work well with me. We had our 
differences from time to time, but I always handled them professionally and never 
let them scale to the level of influencing our tasks.

8) I can bring dedication and a drive to succeed in this company, and strive to do 
 my absolute best for the company I work for. 

9) I should be hired for this role because of my relevant skills, experience, 
and passion for the industry. I did research about the company and I trust I can add value to its growth.

10) With my experience, skills, and certifications, I would expect to receive something
 in the range of 40 to 45 dollars per hour.
